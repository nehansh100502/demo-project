# javascript & classes 

## OOP

## Object

- collection of properties and methods 
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP 

## parts of OOP 

Object literal

- contructor function
- prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Piller

- Abstraction (details height (like as fetch))
- Incapsulation(rap up data)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism(many way)

## multiple instances using this keyword 

1- new object created 
2- constructor function called by new keyword 
3- arguments inject in this keyword
4- output in functions..

## prototype behavior (inheritence)

## read about new keyword .....

- a new object is created 
- a prototype is linked
- the constructor is called
- the new object is returned 

## static keyword :

- A static method (or static function) is a method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.

## closures : 

- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

- In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
